Que: What is an Architecture of JDBC?
Sol:
                                                 Java Application

                                                 JDBC API

                                                 JDBC Driver Manager

 JDBC Driver Software                           JDBC Driver Software                        JDBC Driver Software
 For Oracle                                     For MySQL                                   For PostgresSQL

# 1. Java Application
# 2. JDBC API            : JDBC an API help to connects the Java Application with the DataBase.
# 3. JDBC Driver Manager : Driver Manager is the Class that present in the in the java.mysql package. So, basically
                           the Driver Manager is responsible to the connect the Java Application to database with the
                           help of Drivers Software.
# 4. JDBC Driver Software: JDBC Driver Software working like as a translator. That's helps to convert Java Application
                           calls to the DataBase Specific call and vice verse.
                           We can not interact with the database with Driver Software.
