    /*
    Que: What is the Queue Interface? Time Complexity for Queue? Basic Operation and Properties of Queue?
    Sol: Queue means exactly same as the english word Queue which means a row or line. Similar as Queue, Queue Interface
         also work as similarly and follow FIFO Operation that first in first out.

     5. Ordering is allowed in Queue Interface.
