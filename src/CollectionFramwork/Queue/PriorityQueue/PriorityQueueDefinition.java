    Que: What is PriorityQueue? Basic Operations on PriorityQueue and properties?
    Sol: PriorityQueue is a class in java that's implements Queue Interface in Java. But as we know Queue Interface
         only follow FIFO (First In First Out). But sometimes we need to process data as per their priority and this
         priority all are set by the heap memory. So, while we need to represent data as per the priority we follow
         PriorityQueue class collection framework.

      #Properties:-
      1. Duplicate allowed.
      2. Null value does not allowed.
      3. Priority base data arrangement.
      4. Does not allow mixture of data element.

      #Syntax:

      PriorityQueue ab = new PriorityQueue();
