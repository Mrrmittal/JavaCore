    Que: What is HashSet ? Time Complexity for HashSet ? Basic Syntax and Operations on HashSets?
    Sol: HashSet come into the java.util package. HashSet implements the Set interface that's why HashSet also not allow
         duplicate element and does not follow sequencing. So, While we need to right a program when we do not care
         about the ordering and duplicate elements. We can use HashSet. Objects class equals() and hashCode() methods
         help us to provide the better use of HashSet like Classes.

         Null Elements also allowed in HashSet.

     # Time Complexity for using HashSet:
        Insertion :- O(1)
        Search :- O(1)
        Deletion :- O(1)

     # Basic Syntax of using HashSet

     Set<Integers> set = new HashSet<Integers>();
