    Que:  What is LinkedHashSet ? Time Complexity for LinkedHashSet ? Basic Syntax and Operations on LinkedHashSet?
    Sol: LinkedHashSet is also the derived from java.util package. LinkedHashSet is the ordered version of HashSet.
         LinkedHashSet is also does not allow the duplicate element. but allow the elements present into the order.
         While we write a program where we care about the order of element and does not need the extra duplicate
         elements where we can use LinkedHashSet.

     # : Time Complexity for LinkedHashSet?
         Insertion:- O(1)
         Deletion:- O(1)
         Search:- O(1)

     # Syntax: Set<> set = new LinkedHashSet<>();
