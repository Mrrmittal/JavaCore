    Que: What is TreeSet ? Properties TreeSet ? Basic Syntax and Operations on TreeSet?
    Sol: TreeSet is a Sorted kind of data Structure. TreeSet is the direct Implementation of the Navigable Interface
         and Indirect Implementation of SortedSet and Set Interface.

     #  Properties of TreeSet:
     1. Follow BST algorithm for data representation.
     2. Do not Allow Duplication of element.
     3. Allow Only Homogenous data.
     4. Sorted representation.
     5. Does not allow index based operations.
     6. Also implement Serializable and Cloneable Interface.
     7. Does not allow null value.

     #Basic Syntax:
        TreeSet ts = new TreeSet();
