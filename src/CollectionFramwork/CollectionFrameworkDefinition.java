    /*
Que: What is Collection Framework and use of Collection Framework in Java?

Solution : As we Know Java is an Object-Oriented Programing language. So we can not imagine object-Orientation
           programming without using Data Structure and Algorithms. So, Basically Collections Frameworks help us to
           provide the data store property and then Some basic Implementation on it.

           Like : Add Object into the collection.
                  Remove element from the collection.
                  Replace element from the collection.
                  sorting data in ascending and vice verse
                  Iteration.
