Que: What is Thread Communication ? and why it is so important?
Sol: Thread Communication is basically helpful to prevent CPU extra working and free CPU on time without any time and
     Memory wastage. Thread Communication is very necessary and can be achieve by using basic 3 object class methods
     wait(), notify(), notifyAll(). And these methods can only be used into the intrinsic locks(synchronized keyword).

     So, the basically thread communication only important for save the time and working of the CPU.


     For eg: There is two resources like consumer and producer. So, consumer thread always check to produce if its they
             produce the resources or not and if yes consumer will consume it. So, at that time without implementing
             Thread communication. consumer thread check time to time. But while using of thread communication, the
             producer notify() the consumer to consume the things.

     Thread Communication is essential for optimizing CPU usage by preventing unnecessary work and freeing up the CPU
     when it's not needed. It helps avoid wasted CPU time and memory by allowing threads to coordinate their actions.
     This communication can be achieved using three key methods from the Object class: wait(), notify(), and notifyAll().
     These methods are used in synchronized blocks or methods (i.e., intrinsic locks) to manage thread interactions.

     In essence, thread communication is important for efficient CPU usage by allowing threads to wait for specific
     conditions, rather than continuously checking, which could otherwise lead to wasted CPU cycles.
