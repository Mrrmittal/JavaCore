Que: What is Locks? Types of Locks and their benefits?
Sol: Locks: So basically locks are help to provide synchronicity to the program and help to prevent the data misleading
     false data reading and writing at the time of shared resources.

       for eg: SBI Bank Account have : 100rs. MR.X and Mrs.X both want to withdraw amount of 100 at the same time.
               therefore, both reads same 100rs available at the bank account. but both of them can't withdraw.
               here are the concept of locks help to provide a lock to one thread only at the same time while both are
               working on the shared resources.



      Types: These are basically two types of locks:
             1.) Intrinsic : By using Synchronized keyword.
             2.) Explicit : By using locks by explicitly.
