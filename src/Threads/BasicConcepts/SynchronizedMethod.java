Que: How we can achieve the concepts of Synchronization by using Synchronized Method in java?
Sol: As we know every object in java a special LOCK. and object have two category. 1 is Synchronized and another
     one is UnSynchronized. If we use Synchronized keyword then we can activate the lock for the area of task where
     object will perform and can not allow to access the task area to another until thread is not dead or complete
     his task.

     Therefore, to achieve Synchronization by synchronized method we can add keyword synchronized at the time of method
     generation.
