    Que: Define Thread and why we need multiple threads in programming?
    Sol: Threads is an execution line and smallest unit that helps to execute the program in a linear way.
         Thread works independently on the process. Threads basically helps to execution the task.


     # Why need of Multiple threads needs?
      Let suppose we have 3 different-different independent task in our application. But we have only single threaded
      system. so, while the first line of code is not respond or execute until another line of will not be execute
      because our single threaded busy with first program. Therefore, we need multiple Thread in programming. To
      make execution fast.

      # How can create Threads in Java?
        There are mainly two methods in Java to create a Thread.
        1. By Thread Class
        2. By using Runnable Interface.
