    #Early we had discussed this earlier, Multitasking is basically two types.

    1. Process Based Multitasking: Process based multitasking means to perform multiple tasks with using different
        Application in a single time or simultaneously.

     2. Thread Based Multitasking : Thread based multitasking means to perform multiple tasks with using same
        application in a Single time. For eg: we are using whatsapp then we can perform multiple task their
        simultaneously.

        # while learn about java we will only read or discussed the Thread based Multitasking.
