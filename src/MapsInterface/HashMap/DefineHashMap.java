    Que: What is HashMap ? Properties and time Complexity? How to create? Capacity and Load factor
    Sol: HashMap is a class that's implements Maps Interface in Java. Useful while need to represent object in keys and
         value Pairs. Insertion order is not to be followed by the HashMap.

     #Properties and Some Key Points:
     1. Present in Java.util package.
     2. A class that Implements the Maps Interface.
     3. Object representation in Key and value pair.
     4. Insertion Order not to be followed.
     5. Duplicate Keys not allowed.
     6. Allow key to be Null.
     7. Mixing data Type are allowed.

     #Time Complexity
     O(1) Constant for Insertion, Deletion, Searching.

     #Capacity and Load Factor
     Capacity :- 16
     load Factor :- 0.75
     rehashing:- 2^4, 2^5 .......
