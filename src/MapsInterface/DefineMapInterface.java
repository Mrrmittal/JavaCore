    Que: What is Maps Interface in Java?Need and How its Works. And Maps Interface architecture?
    Sol: Maps is an Interface in Java. Misconception is that is also the part of Collection Interface. But Maps does
         not extend Collection Interface in Java. Maps work as Key and value pair.

     # Need of Using maps:  while we need to represent Object with key and value pair.
     # Properties:
      1. Map is an Interface. Present in Java.util package.
      2. Not the Subtype of Collection Interface.
      3. Represent object in key and value pair.
      4. Key need to be unique.
