    /*
    1. HashCode is basically used to increase the performance of collections of Data.
    2. Mainly we can say that HashCode is the ID Number of an Object but isn't Unique every time.
    3. HashSet HashMap Kind of Collection Interface used HashCode to define how to store the  data.
    4. HashCode() Method is pre-defined method of object class in java to generate an ID number while the Object
       creation in Java.
    5. hashCode() return int value of the Object.
    Important Note :- HashCode helps to Classify the Object into the Bucket. Let suppose we have 100
                      Objects. And we need to Compare them So hashCode() method helps to classify these all object into
                      the bucket as per their property value. So we do not need to compare or check all object with
                      their content value. We only need to check with their hashCode() because same hasCode() refers to
                      the same content objects.
