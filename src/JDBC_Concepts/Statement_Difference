Que: Difference among all three Interfaces?
Sol: 1. Statement Interface :
            create statement : Statement st = con.createStatement("No parameter required");
            implement : st.executeUpdate(String SQL); st.executeUpdate(String SQL);

      #Advantage    : We need to create an object once and does not need to create object again and again.
      #Disadvantage : The basic disadvantage is every time query will compile on every time building an Application.
                      even in 1cr+ time.
                      So, Performance Will be decrease.



     2. PreparedStatement Interface :
                 create statement : PreparedStatement pst = con.PreparedStatement(String SQL);
                 implement : pst.executeQuery(); pst.executeUpdate();

           #Advantage   : The basic Advantage is there is no need every time to compile query on every time for
                          building an Application even in 1cr+ time.
                          So, Performance Will be increase.

           #Disdvantage : We need to create dif dif object and does need to create object again and again for every
                          task like insert, delete, update, select.


     3. CallableStatement : CallableStatement are useful to call the stored procedures in the database. In simple words
                            The Callable Statement interface provided by JDBC API helps in executing stored procedures.

                       #create :  CallableStatement cs = con.prepareCall("{call Procedure_name(?, ?}");
                       #method : cs.execute();
